                                cottage industries in the country giving livelihood to most of rural India. A number of
                                handlooms in India are engaged in weaving with natural fibres such as cotton, silk, and wool.
                                Most of the villages in India are directly or indirectly dependent for their bread and
                                butter on the handloom and handicraft sector. This sector carries proudly the traditional

                                was carried out with an objective to gather considered data and references reflecting
                                the aspects and aspirations of this lively craft and its position in the region.
                                The strength and key areas of handloom products is that it believes in introducing
                                of innovative designs and at the same time keeping its heritage elements intact such
                                that replication of the same on power loom will be difficult.
